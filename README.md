# RSSaggregator
Hear we have a project making with MVC pattern on PHP.
Views are very simple and made with Bootstrap.
The main thing that the site does is opens XML file from NASA site by clicking spesial super-button, aggregating it and 
viewing the news list on the main page and the news item with enclosure on the article page. Also the registration and 
commenting on article page was added.
And of course there is an relational database in this project. It has 3 tables: news, users and comments. Setting is
in dbParams.php.
